## 🎯 What is MythOS?

MythOS is a **Fictional Cosmology** that uses an **Sparklet Topology** and **Sparklet Space** to represent everything from quantum fields to magical systems as computable **Factor**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Sparklet Topology

Every concept in MythOS is a **Factor** with identical 16v/35e structure:

```
16 Vertices = Universal cognitive primitives
35 Edges = Fixed relationship patterns
```

## Sparklet Space

### Balanced Ternary Projective System

Each concept occupies a specific position in projective semantic space with coordinates (x, y, z, w) where:

* x,y,z ∈ {-1, 0, +1} with 137-step balanced ternary resolution
* w ∈ [0, 1] (continuous probability intensity)

**MythOS**: Because the universe shouldn't have domain boundaries. 🚀✨
