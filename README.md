## 🎯 What is MythOS?

MythOS is a **universal reality modeling framework** that uses an invariant 16-vertex, 35-edge topological structure to represent everything from quantum fields to magical systems as computable **Factors**.

## 🎯 What is MythOS?

MythOS is a **universal reality modeling framework** that uses an invariant 16-vertex, 35-edge topological structure to represent everything from quantum fields to magical systems as computable **Factors**.

### 🌌 The Big Idea

**All complex systems share underlying mathematical patterns.** By modeling concepts at the topological level rather than domain level, we enable:

- 🧠 **Cross-domain computation** between physics, consciousness, and magic
- 🔬 **Probabilistic causality** across scientific theories
- 🎭 **Coherent fantasy worldbuilding** with scientific rigor
- 🗣️ **Linguistically grounded conlangs** from first principles

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
# Import cosmic standard library
from lib.meta import StringTheoryFactor, ConsciousnessFactor

# Compose your reality
my_world = StringTheoryFactor * ConsciousnessFactor

# Compute cross-domain probabilities
magic_probability = P(SpellWorks | StringVibrations & ConsciousWill)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The Invariant Topology

Every concept in MythOS is a **Factor** with identical 16v/35e structure:

```
16 Vertices = Universal cognitive primitives
35 Edges = Fixed relationship patterns
```

### Core Components

- **`/lib/`** - Cosmic standard library
- **`/proc/model/`** - Active reality instances (LURD hierarchies)

## 📚 Factor Examples

| Factor | Domain | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `StringTheoryFactor` | Physics | Vibrational reality foundation |
| `ConsciousnessFactor` | Philosophy | Subjective experience modeling |
| `LURDModel` | Cosmology | Multi-scale reality addressing |
| `ManifoldFactor` | Mathematics | Spatial relationship primitives |

## 🎮 Use Cases

### For Worldbuilders

```python
# Create magically rigorous worlds
magic_system = StringTheoryFactor.with({
    "spells": "specific vibrational patterns",
    "mana": "harmonic resonance energy"
})
```

### For Conlangers

```python
# Generate vocabulary from cosmic primitives
word_tree = ConsciousnessFactor.expand_vocabulary()
grammar = ComputationalFactor.derive_syntax()
```

## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Map** scientific theories to Factors
2. **Compute** using invariant topological relationships
3. **Derive** fantasy systems from scientific foundations
4. **Verify** consistency across all scales

## 📈 Project Status

| Component | Status | Next Milestone |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Core Topology | ✅ Stable | Production ready |
| `/lib/meta/` | 🚧 Building | 8/16 Factors complete |
| Runtime Engine | 🔬 Research | Probabilistic causality |
| Documentation | 📖 Writing | Tutorial series |

## 🎯 Coming Soon

- [ ] **MythOS Engine** - Runtime for multi-Factor computation
- [ ] **Reality Compiler** - From Factors to executable cosmologies
- [ ] **Cosmic Debugger** - Visualize cross-domain causal flows
- [ ] **Educational Mode** - Learn frontier sciences through building

## 🤝 Contributing

We're looking for:

- **Worldbuilders** to stress-test fantasy applications
- **Conlangers** to develop conlang generation tools

**Join us in building the periodic table of cosmic concepts!**
