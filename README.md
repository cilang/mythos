## 🎯 What is MythOS?

MythOS is a **Fictional Cosmology** that uses an **Sparklet Topology** and **Sparklet Space** to represent everything from quantum fields to magical systems as computable **Factor**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Sparklet Topology

Every concept in MythOS is a **Factor** with identical 16v/35e structure:

```
16 Vertices = Universal cognitive primitives
35 Edges = Fixed relationship patterns
```

## Sparklet Space

### Balanced Ternary Projective System

Each concept occupies a specific position in projective semantic space with coordinates (x, y, z, w) where:

x,y,z ∈ {-1, 0, +1} with 137-step balanced ternary resolution
w ∈ [0, 1] (continuous probability intensity)

137-Step Balanced Ternary Distribution:

Negative (-1 to 0): 68 steps  [-1.000, -0.985, ..., -0.015]
Neutral  (0):       1 step    [0.000]
Positive (0 to +1): 68 steps  [+0.015, ..., +0.985, +1.000]
Total:              137 steps

Constrained by the 3-sphere condition:

x² + y² + z² + w² = 1

### Semantic Dimensions & Balanced Ternary

X-Axis: Polarity (137 steps between -1,0,+1)

* -1 = Potential/Input/Receptive
* 0 = Essence/Operator/Process
* +1 = Manifest/Output/Expressive

Y-Axis: Engagement (137 steps between -1,0,+1)

* -1 = Initiation/Active
* 0 = Neutral/Balanced
* +1 = Response/Reactive

Z-Axis: Logic (137 steps between -1,0,+1)

* -1 = Thesis/Unity
* 0 = Synthesis/Integration
* +1 = Antithesis/Distinction

W-Axis: Probability Intensity (continuous [0,1])

* 0 = Pure potentiality (unmanifest)
* 1 = Full actualization (manifest)

### Spark Positions on the 3-Sphere

Control Layer (Red) - Polarity Dominant

* spark_a_t = (-1, 0, 0, 0)     # receive  - Pure Potential
* spark_b_t = (+1, 0, 0, 0)     # send     - Pure Manifestation
* spark_c_t = (-1/√2, +1/√2, 0, 0)  # dispatch - Why-Who
* spark_d_t = (+1/√2, -1/√2, 0, 0)  # commit   - What-How
* spark_e_t = (-1/√3, -1/√3, +1/√3, 0)  # serve    - When-Where
* spark_f_t = (+1/√3, +1/√3, -1/√3, 0)  # exec     - Which-Closure

Operational Layer (Green) - Engagement Dominant

* spark_1_t = (0, -1, 0, 0)          # r1 - Initiation
* spark_2_t = (0, +1, 0, 0)          # r2 - Response
* spark_4_t = (0, 0, -1, 0)          # r4 - Integration
* spark_8_t = (0, 0, +1, 0)          # r8 - Reflection
* spark_7_t = (0, +1/√2, -1/√2, 0)   # r7 - Consolidation
* spark_5_t = (0, -1/√2, +1/√2, 0)   # r5 - Propagation

Logical Layer (Blue) - Logic Dominant

* spark_3_t = (-1/√2, 0, -1/√2, 0)   # r3 - Thesis
* spark_6_t = (+1/√2, 0, -1/√2, 0)   # r6 - Antithesis
* spark_9_t = (0, 0, 0, 1)            # r9 - Synthesis (pure actualization!)

Meta Center (Gray)

* spark_0_t = (0, 0, 0, 1)            # meta - Essence Center (actualized)
