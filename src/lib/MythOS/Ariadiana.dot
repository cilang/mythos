Includes Contract binding (power delegation), Cultivation inheritance (technique transmission), and Destiny threading (purpose continuation).

The Chronicle actively shapes reality through resonance; recording an event can reinforce or alter its manifestations. Chandra's reincarnation cycle is a major disturbance in the Chronicle's flow.";];

Each Practitioner has Contract slots (1 per 10 ranks) for binding with entities/artifacts. Law Manipulation (Rank 100+) operate on different principles, often becoming forces of nature. Chandra's mixed heritage gives him unusual rank progression.";];
